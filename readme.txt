Weekly Progress:

Week 1,2 progress:

•Installations: python IDLE
1.We have started with GUI implementation using python libraries.
  We are using tkinter python library to create a window.
  We have to still do the gui the above snapshot is the practiced code snapshot.

2.We learnt to capture input image using python libraries in real time.
• We used opencv libraries.

3.We have converted the captured image colored image into gray scale image(only for real time image)

4.We have collected datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/ryeltsin/finger-vein this website.

5.We are trying to implement canny edge detection but there are some errors we are looking into that.

6.We have rectified the error while installing and could execute sample canny edge detection program for one data.

7.We are working on CNN implementation.

Week 3 progess:

1. We have improvised gui using youtube tutorials and edureka website.

2. We used filtering techniques to remove noise from the image.

3. Among filtering techniques(gaussian , averaging, median) we considered working on median filter which is fast and suitable for non-linear data.
