Weekly Progress:
During phase-1 :
we have referred through base papers. We got idea of how to implement the project. Through base papers we learnt which algorithms to be used and also about convolutional neural network. We got to know about scope ,advantages and disadvantages of the project. We collected some of the datasets .

1.Installations: python IDLE.
  We have started with GUI implementation using python libraries.
  We are using tkinter python library to create a window.
  We have to still do the gui the above snapshot is the practiced code snapshot.

2.We learnt to capture input image using python libraries in real time.
  We used opencv libraries.

3.We have converted the captured image colored image into gray scale image(only for real time image)

4.We have collected datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/ryeltsin/finger-vein this website.

5.We are trying to implement canny edge detection but there are some errors we are looking into that.

6.We have rectified the error while installing and could execute sample canny edge detection program for one data.

7.We are working on CNN implementation.
